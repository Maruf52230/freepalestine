 You're going for a cinematic intro â€” something like a Star Wars-style scroll or a dramatic opening screen. Iâ€™ll give you a structured outline and prompt-style guide you can use to build this from scratch using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ðŸŽ¬ Prompt Series: Cinematic Intro Web Animation  
### Goal  
Create a dramatic, cinematic intro screen using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The animation includes:
- A black background  
- Text scrolling from bottom to top  
- White and blood-red text  
- Optional background music or sound effects  
- Overlayed images (e.g., logos, characters, background overlays)

---

### âœ… Prerequisites  
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS animations, and vanilla JavaScript  
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)  
- Live server or static hosting to preview animation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Prompt 1: Project Setup

### Task  
Create a basic HTML page with a `<head>` for styles and a `<body>` container to hold all cinematic elements.

### Files Involved  
- `index.html`  
- `style.css`  
- `script.js`  

### Success Criteria  
- HTML document with linked CSS and JS files  
- Body has a container for text and images  
- All files correctly referenced

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Prompt 2: Base Styling

### Task  
Style the entire screen with:
- Black background  
- White default text  
- Blood red (#8B0000 or similar) for dramatic keywords  
- Centered text container with vertical scrolling animation

### Success Criteria  
- Fullscreen black background  
- Text readable in white and blood red  
- Fonts styled for cinematic feel (use Google Fonts like "Bebas Neue" or "Cinzel")  
- Text animates from bottom to top smoothly

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Prompt 3: Scrolling Animation

### Task  
Create a keyframe animation that moves the text container from bottom to top over a set duration (e.g., 20 seconds). Use `@keyframes` in CSS.

### Success Criteria  
- Text scrolls continuously or once from bottom to top  
- Animation can be paused/resumed if needed  
- Works on all screen sizes (responsive)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Prompt 4: Add Cinematic Elements

### Task  
Add overlay images or backgrounds (e.g., transparent PNGs, glowing effects) behind or above the text. Position them with `z-index`.

Optional: Add dramatic background audio.

### Success Criteria  
- Background and image overlays fade in or animate in sync with text  
- Optional music auto-plays or triggers with interaction (note: browsers restrict autoplay)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Prompt 5: JavaScript Control (Optional)

### Task  
Use JavaScript to control the animation (start on click, skip, or restart). Add buttons or key events to control timing.

### Success Criteria  
- A "Skip Intro" or "Start" button  
- JavaScript controls the CSS animation class  
- Interactivity without reloading the page

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Prompt 6: Finishing Touches

### Task  
Add final polish:
- Fade-in/out transitions  
- Responsive design (media queries)  
- Touch support for mobile

### Success Criteria  
- Animation plays well on all devices  
- Text doesnâ€™t overlap or cut off
